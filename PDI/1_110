String errorMessage = ‘ An error concurred while updating the Contact.’ + e.getMesaage()}

}

In which two ways can the try/catch be enclosed to enforce object and field-level prevent the DML statement from being executed if the current loggen - in user doesn’t have the appropriate level of access? 2 answers

- Enforcing object and field permissions
    
    you can also enforce object-level and field-level permissions in your code by explicitly calling the sObject describe result methods ( of Schema.DescribeSObectResult) and the field describe result methods(ofSchemaDescribeFieldResult)
    
    - to check the field level update permission of the contact’s email field before creating a new contact: isUpdatable()
    
    - to check the fild level read permission of the contact’s email field before query for this field : 
    isAccessible()

    The primary purpose of using component-based development is performance and resusability. if your are creating lightning web components, you must come across thescenario where you need to communicate between them .communication refers to passing data beweent two or more components. There can be two cases. either components are connected to each other via soem sort fo rrelationship like a parent-child relationship, or they are independent of each other.unrelated.

    - Parent to child communication
    
    as the name suggests, parent to child component tag in its HTML file and passes data to the child component. To pass data to the child component, we need to define a variable with @api decorator in the child componet to be public and accessed from the parent component.

    in the case of child to parent communication, it ‘s a bit more complicated. From the child component, we are going to pass value to the parent component using custom Event.

    Now let’s look at the apexWireMethodToFunction component from the [lwc-recipes](https://github.com/trailheadapps/lwc-recipes) repo. This component wires an Apex method call to a function. Because the results are provisioned to a function, the JavaScript can operate on the results. Also, the template accesses the data a bit differently than if results were provisioned to a property.
    
    The rendered component is the same as apexWireMethodToProperty (except for the header).

    This component calls the same Apex method as apexWireMethodToProperty. The method must be `static`, and `global` or `public`. The method must be decorated with `@AuraEnabled(cacheable=true)`.
    
    `// ContactController.cls
    public with sharing class ContactController {
        @AuraEnabled(cacheable=true)
        public static List<Contact> getContactList() {
            return [
                SELECT Id, Name, Title, Phone, Email, Picture__c
                FROM Contact
                WHERE Picture__c != null
                WITH SECURITY_ENFORCED
                LIMIT 10
            ];
        }
    }`
    
    The component’s JavaScript code imports the Apex method and invokes it via the wire service. The wire service provisions the results to the `wiredContacts()` function via an object with either an `error` or `data` property. If the wire service provisions `data`, it’s assigned to `this.contacts`, which is used in the template. If it provisions `error`, it’s assigned to `this.error`, which is also used in the template. If the value of these properties change, the template rerenders.

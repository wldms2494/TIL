    Generally, order contains info about the order. Who placed the order, what time they placed it,
    the shipping address associated, the billing address, payment method, when it was fulfilled, etc.
    it often does not contain any information about what was ordered.
    
    The order line generally contains info about what was ordered. this is done because a sigle order can have multiple items in it. so the order line would be specify the item ordered, the quantity ordered and the price charged, and there would be one line for each different item ordered.
    
    shipment - 단순히 배 선박 이런 개념이 아님, 운송을 배편으로 주문할 물품같은 경우에 배에 실어달라는 말이 곧 ‘선적’이다. Shipment는 물품 자체가 어디에 실려서 운송이 시작되었나를 알려주는 것이고, BL은 물품이 운송되고 있다는 것에 대한 증명 영수증과 같은 공식적인 문서개념임.

Which consideration should the developer be aware of when deciding between SOQL and SOSL?
Choose 2 answers
(A). SOSL is able to return more records.
(B). SOQL is faster for text searches.
(C). SOSL is faster for tent searches.
(D). SOQL is able to return more records.

- 
    
    Use SOQL when you know which objects the data resides in , an you want to : 
    -  retrieve data from a single object or from multiple objects that are related to one another
    
    - count the number of records that meet specified criteria
    - sort results as part of the query
    - retrieve data from number, date , or checkbox fields.
    
    Use SOSL when you don’t know which object or field the data resides in , and you want to : 
    
    - 
    
    retrieve data for a specific term that you know exists within a field. Because SOSL can tokenize multiple terms within a field and build a search index form this, SOSL searches are faster and can return more relevant results. 
    
    - retrieve multiple objects and fields effiecitently where the objects might or might not be related to one another.
    - retireve data for a particular division in an org using divisions feature
    - SOSL doesn’t support big objects.
    
    performace consideration ! 
    
    both soql where filters and SOSL search queries can specify text you should look for. When a given search can use either languages, SOSL is generally faster that SOQL if the search expression uses a CONTAINS term 
    
    SOSL can tokenize multiple terms within a field and builds a search index off this. 
    
    if you ‘re searching for specific distinct term that you know exists within a field, you might find SOSL is faster than SOQL for these search .

    aggregate Function (집계 함수)
    
    기본적으로 집계는 이미 된 계산들을 한데 모아서 계산한다는 뜻을 가지고 있음. 
    
    집계 함수란, 데이터들을 임의로 정리해 보여주는 역할을 하는 함수라고 예상할 수 있다. 
    
    집계함수의 특징 중 하나는, 여러 행들의 그룹이 모여서 그룹 당 단 하나의 결과를 돌려주는 함수이다.
    
    group by 절은 행들을 소그룹화 한다.
    
    select, having, order by 절에 사용할 수 있다. 
    
    you can use aggregate functions without using a GROUP BY clause. 
    you could use the AVG() aggregate function to find the average *Amount* for all your opportunities
    
    ex ) AggregateResult [] groupedResults = [SELECT AVG(Amount)aver FROM Opportunity];
    Object avgAmount = groupedResults[0].get(’aver’);
    
    *any query that includes an aggregate function returns its results in an array of AggregateResult objects. AggregateResult is a read only sObject and is only used for query results
    
    Aggregate functions become a more powerful too to generate reports when you use them with a GROUP BY clause. you could find the average Amount for all your opportunities by campaign.
    
    ex)
    
    AggregateResult[] groupedResults = [SELECT CampignId, AVG(Amount) FROM Opportunity GROUP BY CampaignId];
    
    for(AggregateResult ar : groupedResults) {
    
    System.debug(’Campaign ID’ + ar.get(’CampaignId’));
    
    System.debug(’Average amount’  + ar.get(’expr0’);
    
    Any aggregated field in a SELECT list that does not have a an alias (별명???) automatically gets an implied alias with a format **expri,** where i denotes the order of the aggregated fields with no explicit aliases. The value of i starts at 0 and increments for every aggregated field with no explicit alias. 
    
    }

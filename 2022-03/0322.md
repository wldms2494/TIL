# source Commands
Use the source commands to push and pull sourced to and from your scratch orgs(test), to deploy and retrieve source to and from non-source-tracked orgs,   
to see synchronization changes between your project and scratch orgs, and to convert your source to the metadata format for Metadata API deployments

usually use :
sfdx force:source:push
sfdx force:source:deploy

### push the metadata to the scratch org
a. open the command palette and attempt to run the `SFDX: Push Source to Default Scratch Org` .  
If you are unabled to locate the command, it's because the Salesforce extensions aren't recognizing that the scratch org that you create from the terminal is your org.
the easiest solution is to restart vs code and try again  
Another option is to ask your instructor to show how to togle your default org to your Dev hub and back?

- Starting SFDX: Push Source to Default Scratch Org.  

  the text above is the command you used in the Command Palette (SFDX: Push Source to Default Scratch Org)  
  
- sfdx force:source:push --json --loglevel fatal  
   this is the actual CLI command executed. You could have typed this command your self the Terminal window     
   
   그래서 팔레트 창에 push Source to Default scratch Org 와 `force:source:push --json`이랑 같았음   
- All of the files that were pushed from the scratch org are listed 콘솔창에. If there were any issues, you would see them here
- sfdx force: source:push ended with exit code 0  
  Ensure you get an exit code of 0, otherwise, check and fix the errors before you commit again.
  
  ### 푸시 자동화?
  A. Review the builder script located at .vscode/tasks.json .
B. Line 8 invokes the same command we did above (sfdx force:source:push
--json).
C. Lines 9-12 deﬁne this task as the default build task.
D. Lines 13-19 deﬁne how this task will behave.

봤쥬? 이런식으로 실행 된다 이정도만 알고
  > Task: Run Build Task 

Please observe:
● All of your unsaved ﬁles are saved before this starts (awesome!).
● This process can be done asynchronously, just keep coding away.
● A new terminal window is created. You can switch between terminal windows
with the picklist shown.
● > Executing task: sfdx force:source:push <
○ This is executing the sfdx force:source:push --json
--forceoverwrite command. The –forceoverwrite means that
any changes in our local ﬁles will take precedence.
● In the previous screen, there were no ﬁles pushed (see the pushedSource list,
which is empty).
○ Do not worry, this just means there were no code changes after the
last push. Remember that the push command only sends the
metadata that has changed since the last push was executed, and we
just executed a push in step 3.
● If there were actual changes that needed to be saved, you would see a list of
ﬁles that were pushed (pushedSource would have the ﬁles pushed).
● If there were errors during the deployment, you would see the list of errors as
shown below. Please note these attributes in the result:
○ The status is 1 (not 0).
○ The result tells you what error happened


아 그것두!!
로컬에서 org로 푸쉬하고  
org에서 다시 또 라이트닝 앱빌더 등으로 뚝딱하면
다시 로컬에서 pull 해주는것도 잊지 말자  
>SFDX: pull source from default Scratch Org (Ensure the previous operation completes with exit code 0)

- **Me** — Dashboard readers see data in the dashboard according to your access to data.For example, if you can only see Opportunities in Canada, then dashboard readers only see data about Opportunities in Canada.
- **Another person** — Dashboard readers see data in the dashboard according to the data access level of whomever you specify. For example, if you choose someone who can see Opportunities from any country, then dashboard readers see data about Opportunities from all countries.
- **The dashboard viewer**— Dashboard readers see data as themselves, according to their own access to data. These types of dashboards are often called dynamic dashboards. Your organization can have up to 5 dynamic dashboards for Enterprise Edition, 10 for Unlimited and Performance Edition, and 3 for Developer Edition. Dynamic dashboards aren’t available in other editions. Additional dynamic dashboards may be available for purchase. Take note of these dynamic dashboard limitations:
    - You can't follow components on dynamic dashboards.
    - You can’t save dynamic dashboards in private folders.
    - You can’t schedule refreshes for dynamic dashboards. They must be refreshed manually.

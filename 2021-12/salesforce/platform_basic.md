# Power Up with App exchange

The possibilities AppExchange offers are exciting, but before you start downloading every app in sight you need to develop a strategy  
A solid AppExchange strategy helps ensure that you’re getting the highest value apps without duplicating functionality or investing in something that you don’t need.  

1. Identify depatments that use or plan to use Salesforce. these are ur primary stakehokeholder(part of ownership)
2. Research what's available on ApExchange that best meets your stakeholder requirements  discuss business case with department heads to determine exact needs. heare are some good question to ask
- what business problem are u trying to sole
- what are you main ain points right now?
- how many user need this app?
- what's ur budget?
- what your timelime?
3. when you find an app that you need , download ur app in test evironment( like sandbox https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.create_test_instance.htm&type=5)
4. if you're choosing between multiple apps, 


after you installed your first app, Apps are installed using sth called a package. to find the package,  
1. From Setup, search and select Installed Packages in the Quick Find box .  
2. Click the name of the package you installed. It will be the same name from the AppExchange download page.  
3. Click View Components to see more information about the package. The Package Details page shows you all the components, including custom fields, custom objects, and Apex classes in the package. This information helps you determine whether you have any conflicts in your own customizations.  

quiz : what you supposed to enter in quick find box in set up after you down load the app ? installed package

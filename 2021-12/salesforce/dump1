(C). The field must contain at least one number and at least one letter
(D). The field contains unique records identifiers from a system outside of salesforce


## external id
is a custom field that has the external ID attribute, meaning that it contains unique record identifiers from a system outside of Salesforce. 
when you select this option, the data import wizard detects existing records in Salesforce with external IDsthjat match those values in the import file.

## what is difference between Record ID and External ID, How are these related to each other?

A Salesfroce Record Id is generated when a record is created.  It is autogenerated by Salesforce and will never change.  It is also gauranteed to be globally unique.
 
External ID s an attribute that you can set on a field. 
This marks the field as a unique identifier from another system. 
It is often used to hold the ID of another system.  Say you have a financial system that you want to load records into Salesfroce, you could create a External ID field to hold the ID from the other system.  
You can now upsert records into Salesforce using the external ID field rather than the Salesforce Id field.  


b -> external id is not case-sensitive(대소문자구분) - for example. "XYZ" will be matched with "xyz"
C - > external ID fields must be custom text, number or email fields.



NO.359 An app builder needs to create new automation on an object.
What best practice should the app builder follow when building out automation7
(A). One Workflow rule per object.
(B). One Flow per object.
(C). One invocable process per object.
(D). One record change process per object.

이고 모임? 
엡빌더는 오브젝트에 자동화를 하나 만들려고 하는데, 앱빌더가 자동화 구축할때 젤하기 좋은 연습이 모냐고?
플로우 아님?

근데 invocable process는 처음 들어봄 (invocable 뜻을 찾다가.. 몬가 명확하게 때리는 의미를 못찾겠는데 약간 호출 가능한 이정도로 이해할련다 ) 

invocable processes
Just like a process can call flows, a process can call other processes. 
Invocable processes are modular processes that start only when another process tells them to.
For example, several criteria nodes in your “Account” process each evaluate some conditions, including whether the account is high value. 
Move those criteria nodes, without the high-value condition that they have in common, into a “Top Account” invocable process. 
Then configure your ”Account” process to invoke the “Top Account” process if the account is high value.

네임스페이스는 패키징 컨텍스트에서 네임스페이스 접두사는 패키지와 해당 내용을 다른 AppExchange 개발자의 것과 구별하는 1에서 15자의 영숫자 ID입니다.
네임스페이스 접두사는 대/소문자를 구분하지 않습니다. 예를 들어, ABC와 abc는 동일한 것으로 인식합니다. 
네임스페이스 접두사는 모든 Salesforce 조직 전체에서 전역적으로 고유해야 합니다. 
관리 패키지를 사용자가 독점적으로 제어할 수 있게 합니다.

그래서 네임스페이스는 manage package가 필요한거지 unmanagemage 는 필요 없음

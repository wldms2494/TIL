## what is difference between Record ID and External ID, How are these related to each other?

A Salesfroce Record Id is generated when a record is created.  It is autogenerated by Salesforce and will never change.  It is also gauranteed to be globally unique.
 
External ID s an attribute that you can set on a field. 
This marks the field as a unique identifier from another system. 
It is often used to hold the ID of another system.  Say you have a financial system that you want to load records into Salesfroce, you could create a External ID field to hold the ID from the other system.  
You can now upsert records into Salesforce using the external ID field rather than the Salesforce Id field.  


b -> external id is not case-sensitive(대소문자구분) - for example. "XYZ" will be matched with "xyz"
C - > external ID fields must be custom text, number or email fields.

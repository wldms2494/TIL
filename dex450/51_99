    To prevent a SOQL injection attck, avoid using dynamic SOQL queries and [binding variables.](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/modules/soql-for-admins/use-bind-variables-and-aggregate-functions) The vulnerable example above can be re-written using static SOQL as follows.

This method adds the excape character(\) to all single quotation marks in a String that is passed in from a user. The method ensure that all single quotation marks are treated as enclosing strings, instead of database commands.

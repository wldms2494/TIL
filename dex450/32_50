- put fuctions that you want to reuse in the component's helper. Helper funcitons also enable specialization of tasks, such as processing data and queueing server-side actions.
Helper functions are local to a component, improve code reuse, and move the heavy lifting of Java Script logic away frome the clinent side controller, where possible~

NO.34 What is a benefit of using an after insert trigger over using a before insert trigger?
(A). An after insert trigger allows a developer to bypass validation rules when updating fields on the
new record.

has access to all org data
(D). Profiles are visible in a test even if a class is annotated @istest (seealldata=false)
(E). A class containing test methods counts toward the apex code liit regardless of any @istest
annotation (Missed

    class에다가 @istest (seealldata = true)를 사용하게 된다면, has access to all org data.  @isTest (SeeAllData= false)라고 메소드에 붙어있어도 무시된다.

(b) Pre-defined  components to give standard Look and Feel.

- trigger
    
    triggers are often used to access and manage records related to the records in the trigger context-the records that caused this trigger to fire.
    
    this trigger adds a related opportunity for each new or updated account if no opportunity is already associated with the account. the trigger first performs a SOQL query to get all childs opportunites for the accounts that the trigger fired on.
    
    Next, the trigger iterates over the list of sObjects in [Trigger.New](http://Trigger.New) to get each account sObject. If the account does’t have any related opportunity sObjects. the for llop creates one.

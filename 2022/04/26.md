Easy Explain about “Case”

My wife, Mary, says she is going out shopping.  I ask her where she is going, she, of course, says, ‘not sure, just out, need a few things.’  Well, I also need a few things.

So I say, ‘Ok Mary, if you are going to the mall, can you grab me some of those fun socks I like? If you are going to swing by Target (*because you KNOW that is happening*) I need some deodorant.  If you are not going to either place, can you at least bring me home some unsweetened green tea from 7/11. Thanks”!

this is Case function 

Case ( wifeDestination , ‘mall’, ‘ fun socks’ , ‘target’ , ‘Deodrant’, ‘Green tea’)

Case (Expression, result1, return1 , result 2, return2, catch all)

A case function has 4 components
1. Experession : the condition you are evaluating

1. Reuslt : the value you are checking for
2. Return : what you want to return for each value
3. Catch - all : in none of these defined result are true, then just do this
